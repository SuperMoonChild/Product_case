Meta Recidivism Rate:
https://www.1point3acres.com/bbs/thread-1066860-1-1.html


In Meta, recidivism refers to the rate at which users who have previously violated Meta's policies or guidelines (e.g., hate speech, harassment, or misinformation) go on to violate those policies again after having their accounts reinstated or receiving a warning.
Meta uses recidivism as a metric to evaluate the effectiveness of its content moderation policies, processes, and tools. A lower recidivism rate indicates that Meta's efforts to address policy violations are successful in reducing repeat offenses, while a higher rate suggests that improvements are needed.
Meta's recidivism metric is likely measured by tracking the number of users who:
Have had their accounts suspended or restricted due to policy violations
Have had their accounts reinstated or received a warning
Go on to violate Meta's policies again within a certain time frame (e.g., 30 days, 60 days, or 1 year)


How did you measure recidivism? Clarification Questions: (1) What are the main purpose to recidivism strategy? Improve Engagement/ (2) Do we have specific segment to target or which area? (3) In what product Facebook, Whatapp or just in general?（4）How to define the recidivism? 
How to measure recidivism? (1) How long? Times since the last crime(violation) happened (2) Severity of recidivism? (The impact of the recidivism DAU% of recidivism) (3) Types(category) of the recidivism (4) Frequency of the recidivism? Average time of particular user will recidivist in a certain period of time?
Next Step Strategy: Overall Impact about Recidivism/ (1) Divide into different segments to analyze.
Fraud Behavior did not capture into the metrics 
False Positive metric, good behavior punishment, retention rate 
Short-Term and Long Term (how to define frequency), dollar transformation. 
What could go wrong with this metric: (1) Not meeting the ultimate goal: Since the motivation of the such behavior is unclear. (2) People will use fake accounts across the platform, so it would be very hard to tight down to one person. (3) The fraud people will work in groups so they will be skewed the dataset (4) The definition of the recidivism would be dynamic, so the definition to include or exclude the accounts will not be captured the whole picture of it.


Parents加入孩子更不愿意用FB了：这个是很老的题目了，楼主把它拿出来讲是因为这里面有一个很经典的，当我们没有AB test可以做了，我们该怎么办？建议大家可以去多看看关于observation study的东西（i.e., propensity modeling, diff-in-diff），这个不一定会考，但是不要让面试官觉得你只会AB test，你要先去justify我们该不该做AB Test，然后再是AB Test。

PSM: Propensity Score Matching, 
Diff-in-diff: Before and After difference (control time for two different groups) 
Will be easily affect by the confounding factors
